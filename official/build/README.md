# The Build

This guide containes all the the steps to go from a pile of parts to an assembled printer into a functioning printer with a known working configuration.

Please read the guide carefully, there are many details that seem trivial but are included because of one or more people got stuck at these points. We as a community want to make sure that everyone has the best experience possible and learn from our mistakes. If you find something confusing and would like clarification, that likely means someone else in the past or future will also find it difficult. Please reach out and we will gladly update the document.

It is designed to be a "universal" setup guide that can be used across all printers in the Voron lineup.  There are some items that are specific to (a) given printer(s), so those sections are specifically marked to be included. If you are building a printer and there is a section marked for a different printer, that section can be skipped.
