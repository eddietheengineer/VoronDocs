# Welcome

Welcome to the world of Voron 3D printers!

This is the Voron Community Documentation site. All documentation found here is community provided and should be treated as such. It is provided as a resource to share experience from Voron owners.

If you are building a Voron for the first time, please see the [first time builders guide](./pre-build/first_time_guide.md)

For the Bill of Materials / Sourcing Guide, please to the the [main website](http://vorondesign.com)

To assemble the hardware, please go to the [assembly guides](./assembly) for information.  There is an assembly guide for each printer model.

Once the hardware assembly is complete, please go to the [setup guide](./setup/README.md) to go from assembled hardware to a working printer.

For continued tuning, or if help is needed after the initial setup, check out the [support section](./support/README.md)
